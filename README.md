# Seafall Steward

Seafall Steward is an Android app intended to assist in playing the board game SeaFall.  This is an unofficial app, unaffiliated with Plaid Hat Games.

Current features:
 - Will calculate success probabilities for various scenarios (standard roll, re-roll weak successes, strong successes count double, weak successes don't count, extra base successes)
 - Calculates chances of taking damage
 - Calculates dice pool based with a wizard-based approach
 
 Known issue:
 In most cases, the values for 1/2 damage are the chances of getting at least that much. However, when you check the box for Strong Successes Defraying Damage, the values are the probabilities of getting exactly that much damage. The probabilities need to be fixed for the first case so it's always exact, rather than at-least.
